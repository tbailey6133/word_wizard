## WORD WIZARD :mage:

This project is meant to be a helper for the NYT game Spelling Bee.

It uses Black for formatting python files, and prettier for formatting html and js files.

When answers are rendered and a word is clicked, definitions are retrieved via the free dictionary api available at this url: https://dictionaryapi.dev/

There's a word counter available at the /wordcounter endpoint, too.

To install requirements:
   
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```    
To start the app:

```
flask run
```

Or

```
./run
```
